### Hi there 👋

😄 I'm Niko (aka. neksodebe) and I'm the guy behind [Parottu](https://www.parottu.me). My pronouns are *he/him.*<br>
🔭 I'm looking for developers to work on [Parottu](https://www.parottu.me) with me! Contact me if you're interested :)<br>

If you look through my public repositories, you would mostly see cringe and old stuff, and that is because I do most my work in separated organizations, or closed source. I don't want anyone seeing my spaghetti code 🍝

📫 Contact me through [E-mail](mailto:neksodebe@gmail.com) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/593755503339765781)
